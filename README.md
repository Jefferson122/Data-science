Hello! Welcome to my Readme presentation showcasing all that I have learned and accomplished during my Master's degree in Data Science,
Big Data, Machine Learning, and programming skills such as Python, Matlab, Power BI, Tableau, AWS, SQL, Kafka, Spark, and Pipelines.

# Overview
I am a student of the Master's degree in Data Science and Big Data, and during my studies, I have gained skills in multiple areas of data science 
and related technologies. I have learned to use tools and techniques to collect, process, analyze, and visualize data with the goal of gaining useful
insights and knowledge.

In particular, I have acquired skills in programming and data analysis using Python,
as well as creating visualizations and dashboards with Power BI and Tableau. 
I also have experience in using AWS cloud services and creating and managing databases using SQL. 
Additionally, I have worked on processing real-time data streams using Kafka and Spark and learned to design and manage efficient and scalable data pipelines.
